Do not attempt to run long every weekend. Plan your long runs well in advance so you can get them in every other weekend. Veteran marathoners should run long every other weekend, or two of every three weekends, in the last three months prior to the race. They should attempt to get in at least five or six runs of 20 to 23 miles. No marathon runner should attempt a long run that will take longer than four hours; the result would be severe fatigue and vulnerability to injury. The last long run should be two to three weeks prior to the marathon. Do not attempt to combine long runs and races on the same weekend."

Sample workouts include: 4 to 6 repeats up a 200- to 400-yard hill at 5k to 10k race pace; 6 repeats of a half-mile at 5k to 10k race pace with a 3-minute recovery; 3 to 4 repeats of one mile at 5k to 10k race pace with a 4-minute recovery.\n\nExperienced marathoners need to improve their speed in order to be able to zip through a marathon at a pace that is faster than their normal daily training pace. They should start with one speed workout per week and, perhaps later, build to two."

Ideally, you should race at least once a month, but no more than twice a month. If you race more you cannot properly recover. Do not race or do hard speed training for approximately two weeks after races of 10 miles and longer, or for approximately a week after shorter races. Your last hard, long race should be no later than three weeks prior to the marathon, and your last hard, short race no later than two weeks prior to the marathon."
